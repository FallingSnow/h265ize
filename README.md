##### Updgrading to 0.4.x
h265ize has experienced a major overhaul. Versions up to 0.3.x are written in bash and should work on most systems. Version 0.4.x onward requires nodejs in order to function.

# h265ize
h265ize is a fire and forget weapon. A nodejs utility utilizing ffmpeg to encode large quantities of videos with the hevc codec.

If you have any questions or h265ize isn't working for you, feel free to open an issue.

## Features
- Works on Windows, OSX, and Linux
- Batch file processing (can process a whole folder)
- Automatically detects video files (only processes video files found within a folder)
- Detects all audio tracks
- Preserves audio codecs
- Preserves audio track titles
- Detects and preserves all subtitles
- Detects audio language, if audio language is not your native language and native language subtitles are provided, makes those subtitle default
- Automatically upconvert vobsub/dvdsubs to srt subtitles on mkv files
- Detects bit depth and uses appropriate encoder profile (10-bit is common in high quality anime, supports 8-bit, 10-bit, 12-bit)
- Verbose and preview mode
- File override detection (doesn't accidentally write over a file that already exists, other than in preview mode)
- Detects if file is already encoded in x265 and skips it
- Ability to make encoding previews
- Take screenshots of a finished encode
- Faulty encoding detection based on before and after video durations
- Maintains file structure in output folder (So in theory you could just take your 3tb movie folder and throw it into the script and the output folder should look that same but with x265 videos)

### Dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Required in order to run h265ize. **Necessary**.
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - Does all the heavy lifting, including encoding. Also used for things like detecting timing, audio/video/subtitle tracks, languages, ect.. **Necessary**.
- [mkvtoolnix](https://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/) - Used for upconverting subs in MKVs, not necessary.
- [vobsub2srt](https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT) - Used for upconverting subs, not necessary.

### Installation
To install h265ize run one of the following command lines to download and install.

##### Base Utility (Unix)
```
git clone https://github.com/FallingSnow/h265ize.git && cd h265ize && npm install && chmod +x h265ize
```
##### Arch Linux (Plus Dependencies)
```
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg nodejs; \
yaourt vobsub2srt-git; \
git clone https://github.com/FallingSnow/h265ize.git && cd h265ize && npm install && chmod +x h265ize
```

### Updating
While in the h265ize directory run `git pull`.

## Usage
`./h265ize [-h|--help] [-d <string>] [-q <0-51>] [-m <string>] [-n <string>] [-f <string>{3}] [-g <string>] [-l <integer>] [-o] [-p] [-v] [--10bit] [--12bit] [--accurate-timestamps] [--as-preset <preset>] [--disable-upconvert] [--no-auto-subtitle-titles] [--debug] [--video-bitrate <integer>] [--he-audio] [--he-audio-format <string>] [--he-audio-bitrate <kbps/channel>] [--force-he-audio] [--no-auto-audio-titles] [--screenshots] [--delete] <file|directory>`

### Options
> -d :Folder to output files to

> -f :Container format to output; Options: mkv, mp4, m4v; default: mkv.

> -g :Directory where new unfinished file is stored

> -l :Milliseconds to be encoded in preview mode; default: 30000

> -m :x265 encoder preset; Options: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow, placebo; default: fast

> -n :The native language used to select default audio and subtitles. You may use 3 letter or 2 letter ISO 639-2 Alpha-3/Alpha-2 codes or the full language name. Examples: [eng|en|English|jpn|ja|Japanese]

> -o :Override mode; Allows conversion of videos that are already encoded by the hevc codec

> -p :Preview mode; Only processe a 30 second preview

> -q :Sets the qp quality target; default: 19

> -v :Verbose mode; Display extra output

> -x :Extra x265 options. Options can be found on the [x265 options page](https://x265.readthedocs.org/en/default/cli.html)

> --10bit :Forces encoding videos in 10bit format (Useful for anime)

> --12bit :Forces encoding videos in 12bit format (Useful for anime)

> --accurate-timestamps :Accurate Timestamps (substantially increases file size but sometimes fixes timestamps)

> --as-preset :My personal presets; Possible values are listed below; I'll be adding more as time goes on

> --debug :Debug mode; Print extra debugging information

> --no-auto-subtitle-titles :Disable automated title generation for subtitle streams that do not have preexisting titles.

> --force-he-audio :Force High Efficiency audio encoding even on lossless audio tracks

> --he-audio :High Efficiency audio mode. Will reencode non-lossless audio tracks.

> --he-audio-format :Select the codec to use when re-encoding. Defaults to `opus`, other options include `aac` (requires `ffmpeg` compiled with `libfdk_aac`), and `prologic` which will downconvert to 2 channel stereo audio encoded with the opus codec and Dolby Pro Logic II.

> --he-audio-bitrate :The bitrate, in kbps **per channel** to re-encode the audio at. Default is 64, minimum is 32.

> --no-auto-audio-titles :Disable automated title generation for audio streams that do not have preexisting titles.

> --screenshots :Take 6 screenshots at regular intervals throughout the finished encode

> --stats: Creates a stats file in the destination named h265ize.csv

> --help :Help; Shows help page

Run `h265ize --help` for more info.

#### Aspresets <a name="aspresets"></a>
| Preset | Description |
|:---:|:---|
| basic | Overall good preset, will always create high quality videos but may produce large files. |
| anime | A very good preset for all types of anime. Produces very good quality for a very small size. Warning: this preset creates a nonconformant, high latency encode. |
| testing-ssim | x265's native preset just in SSIM mode. |

#### Examples
* `./h265izer -v big_buck_bunny_1080p_h264.mov`
* `./h265izer -v -d /home -q 25 -g /home big_buck_bunny_folder`

## Stats file
The stats file is located at the current working directory under the name `h265ize.csv`. This must be enabled using the `--stats` flag. The file is composed of several lines. Each line is in the format

`[Finish Encoding Date],[Filename],[Original Size],[Encoded size],[Compression Precent],[Encoding Duration]`

For exmaple:

`08/13 02:46:03 PM, [deanzel] Noir - 08 [BD 1080p Hi10p Dual Audio FLAC][a436a4e8].mkv, 1964MB, 504MB, 25.00%`

## Creating 10bit encodes
To create 10bit or 12bit encodes, simply pass the `--10bit` or `--12bit` parameters respecively. You may need to install `x265_main10` and `x265_main12` (x265 main10 and main12 libraries) in order to encode in 10/12 bit.
